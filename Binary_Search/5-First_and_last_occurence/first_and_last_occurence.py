''' PROBLEM - Given the sorted array and the number, return the first and the last occurence of the number in the array using binary search '''

Brute Force Approach
---------------------
LOGIC - Find the first find the first occurence and then the last occurence and then return the answer together.

Optimal Approach
---------------------
LOGIC -
The first occurrence of a number in a sorted array is found using lower bound, which returns:
The index of the number if it exists.
If the number isn't present, it returns the index of the next greater number.
The last occurrence is based on upper bound, which:
Always returns the index of the next greater number in the array.
So, if lower bound confirms the number is present, the last occurrence is simply upper bound - 1. 
If lower bound doesnâ€™t find the exact number, return -1 for both occurrences.
