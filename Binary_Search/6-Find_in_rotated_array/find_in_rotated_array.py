find the given target number and return the index.

Brute Force Approach

LOGIC - Linear search- Go over the array one by one and if you find the number return the index.

Optimal Approach
---------------------
LOGIC - Binary Search 
In a rotated sorted array, at least one half is always sorted.
Check if the left or right part is sorted by comparing the middle element with the leftmost element. 
If the target is within the sorted half, search there. Otherwise, move to the unsorted side where the rotation happened. 
Repeat the process until you find the number.

Optimal Approach
---------------------
LOGIC - Binary Search 
In a rotated sorted array, one half is always sorted. 
To find the first occurrence of the target, store the match and continue searching left for earlier instances.
When checking the middle element, identify whether the left or right part is sorted by comparing mid with low.
If left is sorted, check if the target falls in that range; otherwise, move to the right (unsorted) side.
If right is sorted, do the sameâ€”search within if the target fits, otherwise move left.
Additionally, if arr[low] == arr[mid] == arr[high], the search could become infinite (due to duplicates). 
In this case, increment low and decrement high to escape the loop safely.
