## PROBLEM - Create a function that takes the string and convert that string to it's integer representation

- Should stop as soon as you find first non-digit character
- Should ignore whitespaces at start and end
- Return -2147483648 if the number goes below this or Integers's lower limit
- Return 2147483647 if the number goes above this or Integer's upper limit

### We have implemented for the loop and recurstion cause first thinking in loop and then turning that in to recurstion is the real practice of recursive thinking.
