## PROBLEM - Given head (Node object) of Linked List, return the length of the linked list.

### ✅ APPROACH
---------------

- **LOGIC** - *Traverse the Linked List and calculate the length*
    - Take a counter variable "length"
    - Take a mover pointer variable, move the mover to it's next till the mover becomes None and increment the count ever time.

- **TIME COMPLEXITY** - ***O(Size of Linked List)***
- **SPACE COMPLEXITY** - ***O(1)***
