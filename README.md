# 🧠 DSA-by-Heart

This repository is a structured and deeply thought-out journey of my **Data Structures & Algorithms** learning — solved by heart, not just syntax.

---

## 📚 What’s Included?

This repository covers **every major topic** in DSA, in both PYTHON AND C++ and for each problem, you will find:

- 🔹 **Brute-force** solution  
- 🔹 **Better** approach  
- 🔹 **Optimal** approach  

Each solution is written with clear intent to build real intuition behind problem-solving.
