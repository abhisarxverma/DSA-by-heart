# 🧠 DSA-by-Heart

## DSA in two languages : PYTHON AND C++

This repository is a structured and deeply thought-out journey of my **Data Structures & Algorithms** learning — solved by heart, not just syntax.

## 🚀 Course Followed

This DSA repository is a **follow-along with [Striver's A2Z DSA Course](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-dsa-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/)**  
provided by [TakeUForward](https://takeuforward.org). The structure and problem order exactly mirror the course.
